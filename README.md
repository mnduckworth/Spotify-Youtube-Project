# Spotify-Youtube-Project

In this application we give the user the option to select one of six continents (we took out Antartica for this project) and then uses returns a list of the top 3 youtube music videos in that continent.

The user can chose to arrange the search by relevance, most viewed or top rated to give them a wider variety of options to listen to.

If they find a song they like there is an iTunes search bar that allows the users to search the song and it will return a link if anything was found for it on the iTunes store.
